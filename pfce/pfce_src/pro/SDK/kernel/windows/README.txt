Peach Kernel Publisher
======================

This is a collection of kernel modules for different operating
systems that can be used as a basis for fuzzing in kernel
space using Peach.  The kernel modules provide the interface
between Peach and Kernel space, moving data, etc.

At the time of writing this readme only the windows kernel module
is available.

HOW TO USE
----------

This driver must be extended to send data to some interface you want
to fuzz.  Todo this you will need to add code into the PeachDeviceControl
method.  The switch statement contains handlers for IOCTL calls providing
the core of the communication.

At the easiest layer you will need to implement IOCTL_PEACH_METHOD_DATA
(see the "TODO" marker) to handle the data generated by the fuzzer.


INSTALLING DRIVER
-----------------

This driver is not signed so you must disable driver signing in Windows to
use.  Once you have done this place both controller.exe and peach.sys in
the same folder and say:

controller.exe install

Thats it!
